# RomCom  

### Abstract:
We built a webpage that generates romance novel covers either randomly or the user can input data to generate a custom cover. The webpage gives users the option to save covers and view saved covers. The webpage provides users the means to view/create romance novel covers for entertainment purposes.

//(Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

### Installation Instructions:
This webpage runs by user entering the URL into their browser.

[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
We worked 3-4 hours a day for 6 days. We are on finishing Week 2 of Mod 1.

### Learning Goals:
Improving our Javascript fundamentals. Learning how to navigate the DOM and access the HTML and CSS in order to navigate between pages and update elements of the webpage. Another learning objective was to practice using Git workflow to collaborate on this project. We learned how to communicate and problem solve by establishing our DTR, and collaborating with our partner throughout the project. We worked with Github, terminal, and atom.

Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
Write code collaboratively
Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

### Wins + Challenges:
Getting the delete function to work was a huge win because we didn't officially learn about events yet. We fixed the save covers function to not duplicate covers already in the view saved covers page. Learning how to create HTML elements was a big win as well. Not knowing the exact syntax/concepts for the functions we were trying to run was solved by rubberducking with our peers, and individual research online. Github workflow was hard to navigate at first, but we solved these technical issues by reaching out to our rocks.
