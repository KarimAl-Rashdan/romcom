# RomCom  

### Abstract:
We built a webpage that generates romance novel covers either randomly or the user can input data to generate a custom cover. The webpage gives users the option to save and view saved covers. The webpage provides users the means to view/create romance novel covers for entertainment purposes.

### Installation Instructions:
This webpage runs by user entering the URL into their browser.

### Learning Goals:
Improving our Javascript fundamentals. Learning how to navigate the DOM and access the HTML and CSS in order to navigate between pages and update elements of the webpage. Another learning objective was to practice using Git workflow to collaborate with our partner on this project. We learned how to collaborate and problem solve by establishing our DTR and communicate through Zoom and Slack. We worked with Github, the terminal, and atom.

### Wins + Challenges:
Getting the delete function to work was a huge win because we didn't officially learn about events yet. We fixed the save covers function to not duplicate covers already in the view saved covers page. Learning how to create HTML elements was a big win as well. Not knowing the exact syntax/concepts for the functions we were trying to run was solved by rubberducking with our peers, asking mentors and rocks for guidance, and individual research online. Github workflow was hard to navigate at first, but we solved these technical issues by reaching out to our rocks as well.
